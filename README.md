# 🌐 Nandini’s Portfolio

**Cinematic Web Experiences · AI-Powered Products · Modern Frontend**

This repository contains the source for **Nandini’s personal portfolio website**, designed to showcase client-focused work in **modern web development, animation, and AI-driven applications**.

The site is built as a **cinematic, scroll-driven experience** that highlights not just what I do, but **how I think, build, and deliver value**.

## ✨ Purpose of This Website

This website is designed to:

* Introduce **who I am** and what I work on

* Showcase **past projects and hands-on work**
* Demonstrate my approach to **design, motion, and AI integration**
* Provide a simple way for clients or collaborators to reach out

This is **not** a course platform or community site.
It is a **professional, client-oriented portfolio**.
